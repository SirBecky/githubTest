# Google Capstone Project
This is a first repository testing for github after I have finish my Google Data Analytics Course.
## Background Case
Bellabeat is a manufacturer of high-tech women's healthcare products. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to be a big player in the global smart devices market.

Urška Sršen, one of the owners and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing fitness data and smart devices can help open up new growth opportunities for companies.

A stakeholder asked me as a junior data analyst to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discovered will help guide the company's marketing strategy.

### There are 6 phases in Google Data Analytics course: The first phase is ASK.
**1.1 Summary of the Business Task:**  Analyze data from smart device users to gain insight into how consumers are using smart devices non-Bellabeat and apply it to one of Bellabeat’s products. Then, using the insight that has been gained will help guide the company's marketing strategy.

**1.2 Who is the Key stakeholders?** 
- Urška Sršen: Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer.
- Sando Mur: Mathematician and co-founder of Bellabeat; a key member of the Bellabeat executive team.
- Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

### Next, we proceed to second phase which is PREPARE.
**2.1 Description of Data sources used:** 
The dataset used in this analysis is from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data which is available and provided by one of the user "Mobius" in Kaggle platfom.
The dataset is recommended to be use by the course provider Google Data Analytics Course.

This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. The sample in the dataset time frame is taken between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 which were submitted by survey respondents distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk

**2.2 Accessibility and privacy of data**
This dataset fulfills accessibility because it is publicly accessible and open-source. Data privacy has also been fulfilled because all personal information contained in this dataset has been anonymized.

**2.3 Data Integrity and Verification**
The Sample size of thirty users for this analysis seems small when compared to the unknown demographic to be surveyed. Still, sample sizes equal to or greater than thirty are often considered sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem to hold. The genders for the survey are not specified in the dataset since Bellabeat products and services are for women, which results in sampling bias. The datasets used are not current because respondents generated them for a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Finding alternative datasets to support the business task has proven difficult. The dataset available is the dataset we will use to carry out this business task pending the availability of datasets that have the demographics and size needed.

**2.4 How is the data organized?**
