# Google Capstone Project
This is a first repository testing for github after I have finish my Google Data Analytics Course.
## Background Case
Bellabeat is a manufacturer of high-tech women's healthcare products. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to be a big player in the global smart devices market.

Urška Sršen, one of the owners and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing fitness data and smart devices can help open up new growth opportunities for companies.

A stakeholder asked me as a junior data analyst to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discovered will help guide the company's marketing strategy.

### There are 6 phases in Google Data Analytics course: The first phase is ASK.
**Summary of the Business Task:**  Analyze data from smart device users to gain insight into how consumers are using smart devices non-Bellabeat and apply it to one of Bellabeat’s products. Then, using the insight that has been gained will help guide the company's marketing strategy.
